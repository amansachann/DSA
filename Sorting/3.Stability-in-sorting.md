Stability in sorting algorithms means that equal elements maintain their relative order after sorting. This property is important when sorting by multiple criteria, ensuring that previous orderings are preserved. ‚öñÔ∏è

### Stable Sorting Algorithms:
- **Bubble Sort** üîµ
- **Insertion Sort** ‚ú®
- **Merge Sort** üîó
- **Timsort** üß©

### Unstable Sorting Algorithms:
- **Quick Sort** ‚ö°
- **Heap Sort** üî•

Stability is crucial when sorting complex data, like maintaining the order of items sorted by one attribute while sorting by another. üîÑ

### Example:

Consider the following list of objects, where each object contains a "name" and "age":

```js
[{ name: "John", age: 25 }, { name: "Alice", age: 25 }, { name: "Bob", age: 30 }]
```

We first sort by **age**, and then by **name** (if ages are the same).

### Stable Sorting:
When sorting by **name** after sorting by **age**, a stable sort will maintain the original order of **John** and **Alice**, since they both have the same age.

After sorting by **age** and **name**:

```js
[{ name: "John", age: 25 }, { name: "Alice", age: 25 }, { name: "Bob", age: 30 }]
```

Here, **John** and **Alice** stay in the same relative order.

### Unstable Sorting:
An unstable sort might rearrange **John** and **Alice** even though they have the same age.

After sorting by **age** and **name** (using an unstable sort):

```js
[{ name: "Alice", age: 25 }, { name: "John", age: 25 }, { name: "Bob", age: 30 }]
```

Here, **John** and **Alice** have swapped positions, breaking the original order.

### Stability Table:

| Algorithm          | Stability     | Why It's Stable/Unstable                             |
|--------------------|---------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| **Bubble Sort**     | Stable        | Equal elements retain their original order.          |
| **Insertion Sort**   | Stable        | Elements are inserted without changing order of equal elements. |
| **Merge Sort**       | Stable        | Merging maintains relative order of equal elements.  |
| **Timsort**          | Stable        | Combines merge and insertion sorts, preserving order of equal elements. |
| **Quick Sort**       | Unstable      | Equal elements may be swapped during partitioning, changing their relative order. |
| **Heap Sort**        | Unstable      | Equal elements may be swapped during heapification, altering their order. |
